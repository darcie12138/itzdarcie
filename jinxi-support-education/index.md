#### Our Longquan Journey

Gue principles of global citizenship practice and education, the Melton Foundation's projects and activities are closely aligned with the United Nations' 17 Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs), and emphasize grassroots action and cross-cultural cooperation to address the challenges of the modern world.

SDG4 aims to 'ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.' It focuses on providing children and adolescents with quality, accessible education and other learning opportunities, creating a safe, inclusive, and effective learning environment for everyone.

As part of the Melton Foundation's traditional 100 ACTS project
We arrived at Jinxi Town Central Primary School in Lishui City, Zhejiang Province
to carry out a week-long teaching program. 
An endless journey has just begun...

The canteen at Jinxi Town Primary School is small, but a few wooden tables are enough to accommodate all the children in the school. Just this morning, we met the third graders for the first time. On our way to lunch, we encountered them, and a little boy from the class gave us a pear and an egg. It was only when we entered the cafeteria with the egg that we learned it was part of the school's 'nutritional lunch' program, provided only to students in extreme poverty.

Physical education class is often the most anticipated lesson of the week for the fifth graders, and during this time, we witnessed their energy and enthusiasm. After running and warming up with them, the children eagerly requested to start playing games. Eason and Ty led the boys in playing 'Monkey Tricks' on the basketball court, while Xiao Liang and C Zhang guided the girls in a game of 'Sticking Plasters' on the track. The boys quickly grew tired of these games and divided into two teams, asking us to play basketball with them. They were rowdy but also innocent and sincere. That day, after the classes and returning to our homestay, we all reflected on the experience, feeling a return to a sense of pure joy, inspired by these tireless children running back and forth on the sports field.

Before leaving, we prepared postcards from Zhejiang University and notebooks for every child we had taught, inscribing them with heartfelt wishes and blessings from us. What we didn't expect was the children, during the break, carefully opening the door of the rest room and presenting us with Teacher's Day greeting cards and flowers they had folded themselves. The cards were simple, just a piece of cardboard with crooked writing like 'Happy Teacher's Day, Little Fish' and 'Wishing the teacher academic success,' revealing the purest feelings and insights of these young, inexperienced children.

We hadn't anticipated that just a week's interaction would make the children cry and not want us to leave. Perhaps they were simply afraid of parting, because to them, we were the big brothers and sisters who would run around the playground with them and reward them with candy. A third grader asked me, 'Teacher, will you forget about us after you leave?' That moment touched me deeply. He might not yet understand what this journey meant for them and for us, but to me, the children's clear sense of right and wrong, their innocence and authenticity, gave me a wonderful sense of security.
